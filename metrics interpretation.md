# Scales
- dimensions & vector lengths
- Heatmap

### Bloom
- total number of steps (quantity)
- number of steps per Bloom's Taxonomy category (complexity)

If there is a way to have differently capable acteurs doing the same task.
Possible work-around: differentiate ability of models through:

- Rephrased
- different Context

-> must result in different success rate or difficulty metric
