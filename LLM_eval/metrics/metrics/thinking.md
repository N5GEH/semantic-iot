The user query is "Get Sensor Value".

Looking through the API endpoints, I need to find the one that best matches getting a sensor value.

Let me analyze the endpoints:

1. GET /v2 - General API resource retrieval, not specific to sensor values
2. GET /v2/entities - Lists all entities, too broad
3. POST /v2/entities - Creates entity, not getting value
4. GET /v2/entities/{entityId} - Retrieves entire entity, might contain sensor value but not specific
5. DELETE /v2/entities/{entityId} - Deletes entity, not getting value
6. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Gets all attributes of an entity, might contain sensor value but not specific to value
7. PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Updates attributes, not getting value
8. POST /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Updates/appends attributes, not getting value
9. PATCH /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Updates attributes, not getting value
10. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - Gets attribute data, this could be relevant for sensor data but gets full attribute, not just value
11. PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - Updates attribute, not getting value
12. DELETE /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - Deletes attribute, not getting value
13. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value - **This gets the attribute value specifically** - this looks like the most relevant for "Get Sensor Value"
14. PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value - Updates attribute value, not getting
15. GET /v2/types/ - Lists entity types, not sensor values
16. GET /v2/types/{entityType} - Retrieves entity type, not sensor values
17-29. Various subscription, registration, and operation endpoints - not directly about getting sensor values
 
I've identified endpoint 13 as the ideal solution for retrieving a specific sensor value. This precise endpoint allows direct extraction of an attribute's value, perfectly matching the requirement of getting a sensor measurement.
The user query is "Get Sensor Value". This is asking to retrieve a sensor value. Let me analyze the API endpoints to find the most relevant one:

Looking at the endpoints:
1. GET /v2 - General API resources, not specific to sensor values
2. GET /v2/entities - Lists all entities, not specific to getting a value
3. POST /v2/entities - Creates entities, not for getting values
4. GET /v2/entities/{entityId} - Retrieves an entity, but this would return the whole entity, not just a specific value
5. DELETE /v2/entities/{entityId} - Deletes entity, not relevant
6. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Gets all attributes of an entity, not just a specific value
7. PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Updates attributes, not for getting values
8. POST /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Updates/appends attributes, not for getting values
9. PATCH /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs - Updates attributes, not for getting values
10. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - Gets attribute data, this could be relevant but returns attribute metadata too
11. PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - Updates attribute, not for getting values
12. DELETE /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - Deletes attribute, not relevant
13. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value - Gets attribute value specifically! This is very relevant for getting a sensor value
14. PUT /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value - Updates value, not for getting
15-29. Various other endpoints for types, subscriptions, registrations, operations - not directly relevant to getting a sensor value

The most relevant endpoint is clearly #13: GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value
 
I see this endpoint precisely targets retrieving a specific sensor reading. By identifying the entity ID and attribute name, I can extract the exact sensor value needed. It's a direct method to pull the raw value without any additional metadata, making it ideal for straightforward sensor data retrieval.
Let me analyze this task first. I need to:

1. Take a list of 10 ontology properties
2. Classify each as either numerical or non-numerical
3. Return a JSON object with two keys: 'numerical' and 'non_numerical'

The properties to classify are:
- brick:hasSubstance
- brick:hasAssociatedTag  
- owl:disjointWith
- owl:equivalentClass
- rdfs:subClassOf
- rdfs:comment
- brick:hasQuantity
- skos:definition
- rdfs:label
- rdfs:seeAlso

Let me think about each one:

1. brick:hasSubstance - This connects an entity to a substance (like water, air). This is non-numerical.
2. brick:hasAssociatedTag - This connects to tags/labels, non-numerical.
3. owl:disjointWith - This is an OWL property for class relationships, non-numerical.
4. owl:equivalentClass - This is an OWL property for class equivalence, non-numerical.
5. rdfs:subClassOf - This defines class hierarchy, non-numerical.
6. rdfs:comment - This provides textual comments, non-numerical.
7. brick:hasQuantity - This connects to quantities/measurable values, so this would be numerical.
8. skos:definition - This provides definitions (text), non-numerical.
9. rdfs:label - This provides labels (text), non-numerical.
10. rdfs:seeAlso - This provides references to other resources, non-numerical.

So the classification would be:
- Numerical: ['brick:hasQuantity']
- Non-numerical: ['brick:hasSubstance', 'brick:hasAssociatedTag', 'owl:disjointWith', 'owl:equivalentClass', 'rdfs:subClassOf', 'rdfs:comment', 'skos:definition', 'rdfs:label', 'rdfs:seeAlso']


I'll map out a systematic approach to categorizing ontology properties. The process involves carefully examining each property's semantic characteristics to determine its numerical or non-numerical nature. I'll focus on understanding the fundamental purpose of each property, looking for indicators of quantitative measurement or qualitative description. The goal is to create a clear, logical classification system that separates properties based on their inherent semantic meaning and potential for numerical representation.

The workflow will require precise analysis across multiple properties, with an estimated 12-step sequence that includes initial setup, detailed property examination, and final output generation. Each property demands careful scrutiny to ensure accurate classification within the JSON structure.
I need to analyze the given properties and classify them as numerical or non-numerical based on whether they connect an entity with a measurable quantity concept or not.

Let me break down this task:
1. I need to understand what makes a property numerical vs non-numerical
2. Analyze each property to understand what it connects
3. Classify them appropriately
4. Return a JSON object

First, let me understand the task better:
- Numerical properties: connect entities with measurable quantities or quantity concepts (temperature, count, speed, etc.)
- Non-numerical properties: connect entities with other entities or descriptions

Now let me analyze each property:

1. 'owl:disjointWith' - This is an OWL property that states two classes are disjoint (have no common instances). This connects classes with other classes, not with numerical values. NON-NUMERICAL.

2. 'brick:hasQuantity' - This suggests it connects something with a quantity concept, which would be numerical in nature. NUMERICAL.

3. 'brick:hasAssociatedTag' - This connects entities with tags, which are typically textual labels or identifiers. NON-NUMERICAL.

4. 'rdfs:seeAlso' - This is an RDF property that connects a resource to another resource for additional information. It connects entities with other entities. NON-NUMERICAL.

5. 'owl:equivalentClass' - This states that two classes are equivalent. It connects classes with other classes. NON-NUMERICAL.

6. 'rdfs:subClassOf' - This establishes a subclass relationship between two classes. It connects classes with other classes. NON-NUMERICAL.

7. 'skos:definition' - This provides a textual definition of a concept. It connects entities with descriptive text. NON-NUMERICAL.

8. 'rdfs:label' - This provides a human-readable label for a resource. It connects entities with textual labels. NON-NUMERICAL.


9. 'rdfs:comment' - This provides a textual comment about a resource. It connects entities with descriptive text. NON-NUMERICAL.

10. 'brick:hasSubstance' - This connects something (like equipment or system) with a substance (like air, water, etc.). This connects entities with other entities (substances). NON-NUMERICAL.

I'll categorize the properties based on their connection type. Most properties relate to descriptive or classificational relationships, with only one truly numerical property. The classification reveals the semantic nature of these ontological connections, highlighting how they primarily describe relationships between entities rather than quantitative measurements. I'll analyze the properties systematically, creating a classification method that determines whether each connects to measurable quantities. I'll track numerical and non-numerical properties carefully, ensuring a comprehensive approach to categorizing the semantic relationships. The process involves examining each property's semantic meaning and determining its quantitative potential through careful semantic analysis.
