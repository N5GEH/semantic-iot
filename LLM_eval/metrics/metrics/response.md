- flowchart_node: Analyze property semantics
- context: Analyzing brick:hasSubstance - Brick Schema property connecting entities to substances

EXECUTING:
Analysis: brick:hasSubstance is a Brick Schema property that connects entities (like equipment or systems) to substances (like air, water, steam, etc.). It connects entities to other entities representing physical substances, not to measurable quantities directly.

VALIDATION:
Single action (analyze semantics), single output (semantic understanding), atomic operation.

EVALUATION: Analyze 1 property's semantic meaning
- bloom: Comprehension - Understand property semantics - explain
- dim: Conceptual Knowledge - ontology property relationships
- quantity: 1 - property semantic analysis
- human_effort: 25 - Requires knowledge of Brick Schema - Easy

NEXT: STEP 49: Determine if 'brick:hasSubstance' connects to measurable quantity
- next_flowchart_node: Does property connect entity to measurable quantity?

STEP 49: Determine if 'brick:hasSubstance' connects to measurable quantity
- flowchart_node: Does property connect entity to measurable quantity?
- context: brick:hasSubstance connects entities to substance entities (air, water, etc.)

EXECUTING:
Decision: brick:hasSubstance connects entities to substances, which are other entities representing physical materials like air, water, or steam. While substances can have measurable properties, the property itself connects to substance entities, not directly to numerical measurements.
Result: NO - this property connects to substance entities, not measurable quantities.

VALIDATION:
Single action (make decision), single output (yes/no decision), atomic operation.

EVALUATION: Evaluate 1 property connection type
- bloom: Analysis - Examine property connection - categorize
- dim: Conceptual Knowledge - property connection patterns
- quantity: 1 - property evaluation
- human_effort: 20 - Straightforward categorization task - Easy

NEXT: STEP 50: Add 'brick:hasSubstance' to non-numerical list
- decision_point: Property does not connect to measurable quantity
- next_flowchart_node: Add to non-numerical list

STEP 50: Add 'brick:hasSubstance' to non-numerical list
- flowchart_node: Add to non-numerical list
- context: brick:hasSubstance classified as non-numerical property

EXECUTING:
non_numerical_properties.append('brick:hasSubstance')
non_numerical_properties = ['owl:disjointWith', 'brick:hasAssociatedTag', 'rdfs:seeAlso', 'owl:equivalentClass', 'rdfs:subClassOf', 'skos:definition', 'rdfs:label', 'rdfs:comment', 'brick:hasSubstance']

VALIDATION:
Single action (add to list), single output (updated list), atomic operation.

EVALUATION: Add 1 property to classification list
- bloom: Application - Apply classification rule - employ
- dim: Procedural Knowledge - classification procedures
- quantity: 1 - property added
- human_effort: 5 - Simple list append operation - Trivial

NEXT: STEP 51: Check if more properties remain to process
- next_flowchart_node: More properties to process?

STEP 51: Check if more properties remain to process
- flowchart_node: More properties to process?
- context: Processed all 10 properties, 0 remaining

EXECUTING:
Remaining properties: []
Result: NO - no properties remaining

VALIDATION:
Single action (check count), single output (yes/no decision), atomic operation.

EVALUATION: Count 1 remaining property check
- bloom: Knowledge - Recall remaining items - identify
- dim: Factual Knowledge - counting remaining items
- quantity: 1 - count check
- human_effort: 3 - Simple counting task - Trivial

NEXT: STEP 52: Format results as JSON
- decision_point: No more properties to process
- next_flowchart_node: Format results as JSON

STEP 52: Format results as JSON
- flowchart_node: Format results as JSON
- context: All properties classified - numerical: ['brick:hasQuantity'], non-numerical: ['owl:disjointWith', 'brick:hasAssociatedTag', 'rdfs:seeAlso', 'owl:equivalentClass', 'rdfs:subClassOf', 'skos:definition', 'rdfs:label', 'rdfs:comment', 'brick:hasSubstance']

EXECUTING:
result_json = {
    "numerical": ["brick:hasQuantity"],
    "non_numerical": ["owl:disjointWith", "brick:hasAssociatedTag", "rdfs:seeAlso", "owl:equivalentClass", "rdfs:subClassOf", "skos:definition", "rdfs:label", "rdfs:comment", "brick:hasSubstance"]
}

VALIDATION:
Single action (format JSON), single output (JSON object), atomic operation.

EVALUATION: Format 1 classification result as JSON
- bloom: Synthesis - Organize classification results - compose
- dim: Procedural Knowledge - JSON formatting procedures
- quantity: 1 - JSON object
- human_effort: 10 - Simple JSON structure creation - Trivial

NEXT: Task completed
- next_flowchart_node: End
