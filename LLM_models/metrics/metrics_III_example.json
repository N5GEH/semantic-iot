A value attribute (e.g., \"temperature\", \"co2\", \"pir\")\n\nIn FIWARE, the typical pattern for retrieving entity data is via the NGSI-v2 API. The standard format for retrieving a specific entity's data would be:\n\n```\n/v2/entities/{entityId}\n```\n\nFor retrieving a specific attribute value:\n\n```\n/v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value\n```\n\nFor example, to get the temperature value from the TemperatureSensor:\n```\n/v2/entities/TemperatureSensor:example_room/attrs/temperature/value\n```\n\nBased on the provided data, it seems the general pattern for retrieving a sensor value would be:\n\n```\n/v2/entities/{sensorId}/attrs/{attributeName}/value\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `{sensorId}` is the unique identifier of the sensor (e.g., \"TemperatureSensor:example_room\")\n- `{attributeName}` is the name of the attribute containing the value (e.g., \"temperature\", \"co2\", \"pir\")\n\nThe user asked for the link pattern only, so I'll provide just that without additional explanation.",

GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} - This gets data for a specific attribute, which could be a sensor.\n13. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value - This specifically gets the value of an attribute, which is exactly what we want if the sensor is represented as an attribute.\n\nLooking at these options, #13 is the most specific and directly aligned with getting a sensor value.

        "thinking": "I need to identify the most appropriate ontology class for the entity \"Hotel\" from the provided list of classes.\n\nA hotel is a commercial establishment that provides lodging, meals, and other services to guests/travelers. Looking at the list of classes, I don't see \"Hotel\" explicitly listed. So I need to find the closest match based on the semantic meaning.\n\nLet's analyze some potential candidates:\n\n1. **Shelter** - Too general, as a shelter is any structure that provides protection, not specifically a commercial lodging establishment.\n\n2. **Apartment** - Refers to a residential unit, typically for long-term living, not a temporary lodging establishment.\n\n3. **Hospitality_Box** - This is specific to stadiums and venues, not a general lodging establishment.\n\n4. **Location** - Too general, as this could refer to any place.\n\n5. **Shelter** - As mentioned, too general and usually connotes temporary emergency housing rather than commercial lodging.\n\nNone of these options perfectly capture the concept of a hotel. A hotel is a type of commercial building that provides temporary lodging and services to guests. It's a specific type of hospitality establishment.\n\nLooking at all options again, the closest match might be:\n\n- **Shelter**: Since hotels do provide shelter, but this doesn't capture the commercial and service aspects of a hotel.\n\nHowever, since there isn't a perfect match, I should recommend the class that best represents the concept of a hotel within the given ontology. In this case, \"Shelter\" might be the most appropriate, though it's not ideal.\n\nActually, I think I should consider the broader meaning of these classes. Let me revisit:\n\n- **Shelter**: \"A building serving as a temporary refuge or residence\". This could encompass hotels, although hotels are usually more permanent structures offering temporary accommodations rather than being temporary structures themselves.\n\nAfter reviewing all options, \"Shelter\" seems to be the most appropriate class for a hotel from the given list, though it's not a perfect match.\n\nActually, let me double-check whether there are any other options that might be more fitting:\n\nThe ontology doesn't have a dedicated \"Hotel\" class, but I'm looking for the most appropriate parent class or related class.\n\nA hotel provides lodging services and often includes rooms like bedrooms, recreational rooms, dining rooms, conference rooms, etc. It's a building or establishment that offers these services.\n\nFrom the list:\n- **Shelter**: \"A building serving as a temporary refuge or residence\"\n\nThis seems to be the closest match, but it's not ideal because hotels are commercial establishments offering lodging services, not just shelters.\n\nLet me check if there are any other potential classes that could be appropriate:\n\n- **Apartment**: This is for residential units, not temporary lodging.\n- **Hospital**, **HealthcareRoom**: These are for medical facilities, not lodging.\n- **Office**, **RetailRoom**: These are for work or retail, not lodging.\n\nNone of these fully captures the concept of a hotel.\n\nGiven the constraints of the provided ontology, \"Shelter\" seems to be the most appropriate class for a hotel, but it's important to note that this is not a perfect match and that a dedicated \"Hotel\" or \"LodgingEstablishment\" class would be more accurate.\n\nI should note that if the ontology has a hierarchical structure not shown here, there might be more appropriate parent classes not listed. However, based on the information provided, I would recommend \"Shelter\" as the most appropriate class for a hotel.",

The most appropriate match from the given options would be:\n\n**Shelter**\n\n**Explanation:** While not a perfect match, \"Shelter\" is the most appropriate class as it represents a physical structure that provides accommodation. A hotel is a specific type of shelter that offers temporary lodging services to guests. The ontology does not contain more specific hospitality-related classes like \"LodgingEstablishment\" or \"Hotel\", so \"Shelter\" serves as the closest conceptual parent class.\n\n<output>Shelter</output>",

I need to find the closest or most appropriate class that would encompass a hotel room.\n\nLet's think about what a hotel room is:\n- It's a room in a hotel where guests stay temporarily\n- It typically provides accommodations for sleeping and personal activities\n- It's a type of room with a specific purpose\n\nFrom the classes provided, I can see several options that might be related:\n- Room (base class for all room types)\n- Bedroom (rooms for sleeping)\n- RestingRoom (rooms for resting)\n- Apartment (though this typically implies more facilities than a standard hotel room)\n\nLet me analyze which of these would be most appropriate:\n\n1. Room: This is the base class, so while a hotel room is definitely a Room, there are likely more specific subclasses that would be more appropriate.\n\n2. Bedroom: This is a reasonable match since hotel rooms are primarily designed for sleeping. However, hotel rooms often include additional amenities beyond just a bedroom.\n\n3. RestingRoom: This seems to focus on resting rather than sleeping overnight, so it's probably not the best match.\n\n4. Apartment: While some hotel accommodations can be apartment-style (suites with kitchens, etc.), a typical hotel room is less comprehensive than an apartment.\n\nThere's no perfect match in the provided ontology, but I need to select the most appropriate class. Given the primary purpose of a hotel room is for guests to sleep, \"Bedroom\" seems to be the closest match from the available options. However, if I had to create a proper ontology representation, I would suggest that \"HotelRoom\" should be its own class, possibly as a subclass of \"Bedroom\" or directly under \"Room\" with appropriate properties.\n\nThe most appropriate existing class from the provided list would be \"Bedroom\".",

SensorEquipment/Sensor_Equipment - These are more generic classes for all sensors.\n\nSince \"ambient\" typically refers to the immediate surroundings, and there's no specific class for indoor ambient temperature sensors, I need to make a recommendation based on the available classes.\n\nThe most appropriate class would depend on what \"ambient\" specifically refers to in this context:\n- If it's measuring outdoor ambient temperature: Outside_Air_Temperature_Sensor\n- If it's a general temperature sensor: We'd need to use the generic SensorEquipment class with some additional properties to specify it measures ambient temperature.\n\nGiven the limited context and no perfect match, I believe the most appropriate class would be Outside_Air_Temperature_Sensor if we're talking about outdoor ambient temperature, as this is the closest semantic match among the available classes.\n\nHowever, if we're talking about indoor ambient temperature, there's no perfect match in the provided ontology classes. In that case, I would recommend using the generic SensorEquipment class and perhaps suggesting an addition to the ontology.",

PIR_Sensor: \"Detects the presense of motion in some area using the differential change in infrared intensity between two or more receptors\"\n4. Occupancy_Sensor_Equipment\n5. OccupancySensorEquipment: \"Occupancy sensor.\"\n6. People_Count_Sensor_Equipment\n7. PeopleCountSensorEquipment: \"People count sensor.\"\n\nLet's analyze these options to determine which is most appropriate for \"PresenceSensor\":\n\n- Motion_Sensor: Detects movement but not necessarily continuous presence (someone could be still but present)\n- Occupancy_Sensor: Directly focused on detecting if a space is occupied, which aligns well with presence detection\n- PIR_Sensor: A specific technology implementation (using infrared) for motion detection\n- OccupancySensorEquipment/Occupancy_Sensor_Equipment: These seem to represent the physical equipment aspect\n- PeopleCountSensorEquipment/People_Count_Sensor_Equipment: These count the number of people, which is more specific than just detecting presence\n\nBetween these options, \"Occupancy_Sensor\" seems to be the most appropriate match for \"PresenceSensor\" because:\n1. It focuses on detecting if a space is occupied, which is essentially detecting presence\n2. It's not limited to a specific technology implementation (unlike PIR_Sensor)\n3. It's focused on the sensing function rather than just the equipment aspect\n4. It doesn't go beyond presence detection to count people (unlike the people count sensors)\n\nThe Occupancy_Sensor class is defined as \"Detects occupancy of some space or area\" which aligns perfectly with what we would expect a presence sensor to do.",

A presence sensor's primary function is to detect whether people or objects are present in a space, which is fundamentally what occupancy sensing does. While other options like Motion_Sensor or PIR_Sensor are related, they are either more specific to motion detection (rather than continuous presence) or tied to particular technologies. Occupancy_Sensor best captures the general concept of detecting the presence of people in a space.",

It's specifically named for fresh air, which aligns with our entity.\n\n2. **Ventilation_Air_System**: This is described as \"The equipment, devices, and conduits that handle the introduction and distribution of ventilation air in the building\". This is a broader system concept that includes the entire ventilation air handling system.\n\n3. **Makeup_Air_Unit**: Described as \"A device designed to condition ventilation air introduced into a space or to replace air exhausted from a process or general area exhaust.\" This is specifically for conditioning and replacing exhausted air.\n\n4. **Air_System**: Described as \"The equipment, distribution systems and terminals that introduce or exhaust, either collectively or individually, the air into and from the building\". This is even broader than Ventilation_Air_System, encompassing all air-related systems.\n\nBased on the name \"FreshAirVentilation\", I need to determine if this refers to a specific fan, a complete system, or a unit. The term suggests it could be either a system for bringing in fresh air for ventilation purposes or a specific component like a fan.\n\nSince \"FreshAirVentilation\" doesn't specifically mention \"fan\", \"unit\", or \"system\", I need to make the best judgment based on the terminology.\n\nGiven that we're looking for precision in ontology mapping, and the entity is specifically about fresh air ventilation, I believe the most appropriate class would be either:\n\n1. **Fresh_Air_Fan** - if we're referring to the specific fan component that brings in fresh air\n2. **Ventilation_Air_System** - if we're referring to the entire system that handles ventilation air\n\nSince \"FreshAirVentilation\" seems to emphasize both the \"fresh air\" aspect and the \"ventilation\" process, and without more context about whether it's a component or a system, I'm inclined to select **Ventilation_Air_System** as it encompasses the equipment and conduits that introduce ventilation air into the building.\n\nHowever, if the entity is specifically about the fan component that brings in fresh air (which the name might suggest), then **Fresh_Air_Fan** would be more appropriate.\n\nGiven the limited context and the name \"FreshAirVentilation\" which combines both \"fresh air\" and \"ventilation\" concepts, I'll go with **Fresh_Air_Fan** as it most directly maps to bringing fresh air into a building through ventilation.",

Typically filled with either refrigerant or cold water.\n2. `Chilled_Water_Coil`: A cooling element made of pipe or tube that removes heat from equipment, machines or airflows that is filled with chilled water.\n3. `Direct_Expansion_Cooling_Coil`: This appears to be a specific type of cooling coil.\n\nAmong these options, `Cooling_Coil` is the most general term that directly matches the entity \"CoolingCoil\". It provides a clear definition of what a cooling coil is - a cooling element made of pipe or tube that removes heat.\n\nThe other two options (`Chilled_Water_Coil` and `Direct_Expansion_Cooling_Coil`) are more specific types of cooling coils.
