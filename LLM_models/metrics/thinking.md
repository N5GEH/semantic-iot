I need to classify each property into numerical or non-numerical categories based on whether they connect an entity with a measurable quantity or quantity concept.

Let me go through each property:

1. 'rdfs:subClassOf' - This is a property that connects a class to its superclass. It's about taxonomic relationships, not numerical values. Non-numerical.

2. 'owl:disjointWith' - This indicates that two classes have no instances in common. It's about class relationships, not numerical values. Non-numerical.

3. 'rdfs:seeAlso' - This provides a link to additional information about a resource. Non-numerical.

4. 'skos:definition' - This provides a textual definition of a concept. Non-numerical.

5. 'owl:equivalentClass' - This indicates that two classes have the same individuals. It's about class equivalence, not numerical values. Non-numerical.

6. 'rdfs:comment' - This provides a human-readable description or comment. Non-numerical.

7. 'brick:deprecatedInVersion' - This indicates the version in which something was deprecated. While it could contain version numbers, it's more about metadata/versioning information rather than a measurable quantity. This is borderline, but I'd classify it as non-numerical since it's about descriptive metadata.

8. 'brick:hasQuantity' - This is interesting. This property connects an entity to a quantity concept. Quantities are measurable things like temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc. This would directly connect to numerical/measurable concepts. Numerical.

9. 'brick:hasSubstance' - This connects an entity to a substance (like water, air, etc.). Substances are not numerical values. Non-numerical.

10. 'brick:aliasOf' - This indicates that one entity is an alias of another. It's about entity relationships, not numerical values. Non-numerical.

11. 'rdfs:label' - This provides a human-readable name/label. 

I continue analyzing the properties, focusing on their fundamental characteristics. Most are descriptive or relational, with few directly connecting to numerical measurements. The classification helps understand the semantic nature of these ontological properties.

12. 'brick:isReplacedBy' - This indicates replacement relationships between entities. Non-numerical.

13. 'brick:hasAssociatedTag' - This connects an entity to tags. Tags are typically descriptive labels, not numerical values. Non-numerical.

14. 'owl:deprecated' - This is a boolean property indicating deprecation status. While it could be seen as having a boolean value, it's more about metadata status rather than a measurable quantity. Non-numerical.

15. 'brick:deprecationMitigationMessage' - This provides a message about deprecation mitigation. It's textual information. Non-numerical.

My analysis confirms a broad range of non-numerical properties, predominantly serving descriptive, relational, and metadata purposes across the ontological framework.
Let me analyze each property to determine if it's numerical or non-numerical:

1. 'rdfs:seeAlso' - This is an RDF Schema property that relates a resource to another resource that might provide additional information. It connects entities with other entities/resources, not numerical values. This is non-numerical.

2. 'brick:hasQuantity' - This appears to be from the Brick ontology, and the name suggests it relates an entity to a quantity. Quantities are typically measurable values (like temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc.), so this would connect an entity to a numerical/measurable concept. This is numerical.

3. 'brick:hasAssociatedTag' - This is from the Brick ontology and relates an entity to a tag. Tags are typically labels or identifiers, not numerical values. This is non-numerical.

4. 'owl:disjointWith' - This is an OWL property that states that two classes have no instances in common. It relates classes to other classes, not to numerical values. This is non-numerical.

5. 'rdfs:subClassOf' - This is an RDF Schema property that relates a class to another class in a hierarchy. It connects classes to other classes, not to numerical values. This is non-numerical.

6. 'rdfs:label' - This is an RDF Schema property that provides a human-readable label for a resource. Labels are textual descriptions, not numerical values. This is non-numerical.

7. 'skos:definition' - This is a SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) property that provides a definition or description of a concept. Definitions are textual, not numerical. This is non-numerical.

So the classification would be:
- Numerical: ['brick:hasQuantity']
- Non-numerical: ['rdfs:seeAlso', 'brick:hasAssociatedTag', 'owl:disjointWith', 'rdfs:subClassOf', 'rdfs:label', 'skos:definition']
I need to classify these ontology properties into numerical and non-numerical categories based on whether they connect an entity with a measurable quantity or quantity concept.

Let me analyze each property:

1. 'owl:equivalentClass' - This is used to state that two classes are equivalent. It connects classes to other classes, not to numerical values. Non-numerical.

2. 'owl:disjointWith' - This is used to state that two classes are disjoint (have no common individuals). It connects classes to other classes. Non-numerical.

3. 'brick:hasSubstance' - This appears to be from the BRICK ontology and connects an entity to a substance (like water, air, etc.). This connects to another entity/concept, not a numerical value. Non-numerical.

4. 'rdfs:seeAlso' - This is used to indicate a resource that might provide additional information about the subject. It connects entities to other resources/entities. Non-numerical.

5. 'rdfs:label' - This provides a human-readable name for a resource. It connects an entity to a string/text description. Non-numerical.

6. 'brick:hasQuantity' - This is interesting. In the BRICK ontology, this property connects an entity to a quantity concept (like temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc.). While the quantity concept itself might not be numerical, it represents a measurable property that would eventually connect to numerical values. This seems to be the bridge between entities and measurable quantities. Based on the instructions that properties are numerical if they "directly or indirectly through another class and property) connect an entity with a measurable quantity or quantity concept", this would be numerical.

7. 'rdfs:comment' - This provides a human-readable description/comment about a resource. It connects an entity to descriptive text. Non-numerical.

8. 'rdfs:subClassOf' - This establishes a class hierarchy relationship. It connects classes to other classes. Non-numerical.

9. 'brick:hasAssociatedTag' - This appears to connect an entity to tags/labels for classification purposes. 

This connects to descriptive/categorical information, not numerical values. Non-numerical.

10. 'skos:definition' - This provides a definition of a concept. It connects an entity to descriptive text. Non-numerical.

I've carefully examined the properties and found a clear distinction. 'brick:hasQuantity' stands out as the sole numerical property, as it bridges entities to measurable quantity concepts. All other properties remain firmly in the non-numerical category, dealing with descriptive, classificational, or relational information.
