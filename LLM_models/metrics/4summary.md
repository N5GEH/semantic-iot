        I need to find the pattern in this sequence: 1, 2, 5, 14, ...
            Let me look at the differences between consecutive terms:
        - 2 - 1 = 1
        - 5 - 2 = 3
        - 14 - 5 = 9
            So the differences are: 1, 3, 9
            Let me see if there's a pattern in the differences:
        - 3 - 1 = 2
        - 9 - 3 = 6
            The second differences are: 2, 6
            Let me check if 6 - 2 = 4, so the third differences might be constant at 4? But let me try to find another pattern first.
            Looking at the differences again: 1, 3, 9
        - 1 = 3^0
        - 3 = 3^1
        - 9 = 3^2
            So the differences follow powers of 3! That means the next difference should be 3^3 = 27.
            So the next term would be: 14 + 27 = 41       

        Let me verify this pattern by working backwards:
        - Start with 1
        - Add 3^0 = 1: 1 + 1 = 2 ✓
        - Add 3^1 = 3: 2 + 3 = 5 ✓
        - Add 3^2 = 9: 5 + 9 = 14 ✓
        - Add 3^3 = 27: 14 + 27 = 41

        This seems right. Let me see if I can find a general formula.

        If a₁ = 1, and we add powers of 3:
        a₂ = a₁ + 3^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
        a₃ = a₂ + 3^1 = 2 + 3 = 5


        a₄ = a₃ + 3^2 = 5 + 9 = 14
        a₅ = a₄ + 3^3 = 14 + 27 = 41

        I've discovered a fascinating pattern involving geometric series. The sequence can be expressed as 1 plus the sum of a geometric progression with first term 1, ratio 3, and n-1 terms. This elegant formula captures the sequence's underlying structure, revealing how each term relates to the previous ones through powers of 3.

        Verifying the formula, I'll check several values. For n=1, the result is 1. For n=2, it yields 2. For n=3, the calculation produces 5. For n=4, the result is 14. I'm continuing to validate the pattern, examining the next term's calculation.

        When n=5, the formula gives (1 + 3^4)/2, which equals (1 + 81)/2, resulting in 41. This confirms the sequence's consistency and demonstrates the formula's reliability across multiple iterations.
