        Let me look at the differences between consecutive terms:
        - 2 - 1 = 1
        - 5 - 2 = 3
        - 14 - 5 = 9
            So the differences are: 1, 3, 9
            Let me check if there's a pattern in the differences:
        - 3 - 1 = 2
        - 9 - 3 = 6
            And the second differences: 2, 6
            Let me check if there's a pattern there:
        - 6 - 2 = 4

        Hmm, let me try another approach. Let me see if each difference is related to powers:
        - 1 = 1
        - 3 = 3
        - 9 = 9

        Actually, 1 = 3^0, 3 = 3^1, 9 = 3^2

        So the differences follow the pattern 3^0, 3^1, 3^2, ...

        If this pattern continues, the next difference would be 3^3 = 27

        So the next term would be: 14 + 27 = 41

        Let me verify this pattern:
        - Start: 1
        - Add 3^0 = 1: 1 + 1 = 2 ✓
        - Add 3^1 = 3: 2 + 3 = 5 ✓
        - Add 3^2 = 9: 5 + 9 = 14 ✓
        - Add 3^3 = 27: 14 + 27 = 41

        So the sequence appears to be: 1, 2, 5, 14, 41, ...

        If we continue:
        - Add 3^4 = 81: 41 + 81 = 122
