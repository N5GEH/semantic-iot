        Term Mapping Instructions: 
        
        <term_mapping_instructions>
        <instructions>
        Based on the extraction of available Ontology Classes and Properties and
        the list of terms that need to be mapped to the ontology,
        for each term, you need to select the most appropriate ontology class or property for the domain entity or relation.
        The goal is to inherit the attributes and relations from the selected Ontology Class or Property.

        MAPPING CRITERIA: (in order of priority)
        1. Exact semantic match
        2. Functional equivalence (same purpose/behavior)
        3. Hierarchical relationship (parent/child concepts)
        4. Attribute similarity (same properties/characteristics)

        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Distinguish locations, air systems, devices, actuation points, sensors
        - Avoid category errors: don't confuse the thing itself with infrastructure that supports the thing

        JUST FOR CLASSES:
        - Respect system hierarchies (building → floor → room → equipment)
        - When the Domain Entity seems to be a relation, select a class that would have this relation as a property.

        JUST FOR PROPERTIES:
        - Maintain the direction of the relationship original (subject → predicate → object), e. g.: is_instance_of NOT EQUAL TO is_instanciated_by

        <steps>
        1. Find the suitable API endpoint for accessing numerical values of entities

        1. Map JSON Entities to ontology Classes.

        2. Decide which relations in the JSON file are 'numeric properties' and 'relational properties'.
            numeric properties are properties that have a numerical value, like temperature, humidity, etc.
            relational properties are properties that have a relation to another entity, like 'is located in', 'has sensor', etc.
        
        2.1 Map the relational properties to ontology properties.
            Do not map the numerical properties to ontology properties.

        2.2 Check if the selected ontology classes for the entities of the numerical properties have an (inherited) numerical property.
        
        2.3 If there are extra nodes to be added, add a new JSON entity to an imagenary list of extra nodes.
            The extra nodes should have the name of the property they come from
            Map this newly created entity to an ontology class by using the query '{property_name}'.

        3. Now check again, if the newly created entities have an (inherited) numerical property and do steps 2.2 and 2.3 again before continuing.
        </steps>

        <output>
        Return a JSON, containg:
        - the API endpoint for data access
        - enumeration of the numerical properties and relational properties
        - the mapping of the JSON Entities to ontology classes and properties
        - the name of the properties, that will be added to the JSON Entities as Extra Nodes and the names of the Extra Nodes and their mapped ontology classes.

        - be not devidable into smaller steps

        "thinking": "Okay, I'm given a task to map JSON entities to ontology classes and properties, and to identify numeric and relational properties in the JSON file. Let me approach this step by step as instructed.

STEP 1: Find the suitable API endpoint for accessing numerical values of entities
First, I need to find the API endpoint for accessing numerical values of entities. I'll use the `get_endpoint_from_api_spec` function to find the best matching endpoint from the API specification for accessing the data.

For this, I need:
- API specification path: 'LLM_models/API_specs\FIWAR_ngsiV2_API_spec.json'
- A query to the endpoint: Since we're looking for numerical values of entities, I'll use a query like "retrieve entity attribute values"

I'll call the `get_endpoint_from_api_spec` function with these parameters.

STEP 2: Map JSON Entities to ontology Classes
I need to map the JSON entities to ontology classes. From the JSON Example file, I can identify the following entity types:
- Hotel
- AmbientTemperatureSensor
- HotelRoom
- TemperatureSensor
- CO2Sensor
- PresenceSensor
- FreshAirVentilation
- RadiatorThermostat
- CoolingCoil

I'll use the `term_mapper` function to find the available ontology classes for these terms in the given ontology path 'LLM_models/ontologies\Brick.ttl'.

STEP 3: Identify numeric properties and relational properties
From the JSON Example file, I can identify the following properties:
- name (for Hotel, HotelRoom)
- temperatureAmb (for AmbientTemperatureSensor)
- temperature (for TemperatureSensor)
- co2 (for CO2Sensor)
- pir (for PresenceSensor)
- airFlowSetpoint (for FreshAirVentilation)
- temperatureSetpoint (for RadiatorThermostat)
- fanSpeed (for CoolingCoil)
- hasLocation (for all entities except Hotel)

Now, I need to categorize these properties into numeric properties and relational properties.

Numeric properties (with type "Number"):
- temperatureAmb
- temperature
- co2
- pir
- airFlowSetpoint
- temperatureSetpoint
- fanSpeed

Relational properties (with type "Relationship" or "Text" but referring to another entity):
- hasLocation

STEP 4: Map relational properties to ontology properties
I'll use the `term_mapper` function to find the available ontology properties for the relational properties in the given ontology path 'LLM_models/ontologies\Brick.ttl'.

STEP 5: Check if selected ontology classes have inherited numerical properties
I'll use the `get_non_numeric_classes` function to check if the selected ontology classes for the entities with numerical properties have an (inherited) numerical property.

STEP 6: Add extra nodes if needed
If there are classes without an inherited numerical property, I'll need to create extra nodes based on the property names.

Now, let's execute these steps one by one.

        "thinking": "I need to determine which API endpoint is most relevant to the user query "retrieve entity attribute values". Let me approach this step by step.

STEP 1: Understand the user query
    context: The user query is "retrieve entity attribute values"
    reason: I need to understand what the user wants to do

To understand the user query, I need to break down the key terms:
- "retrieve" - indicates a GET operation
- "entity" - refers to an entity in the API
- "attribute values" - refers to the values of attributes for an entity

The user wants to get (retrieve) the values of attributes belonging to an entity.

EVALUATION:
    bloom: Understanding query intent
    dim: Conceptual Knowledge
    quantity: 3 (retrieve, entity, attribute values)
    human_effort: 2

STEP COMPLETE

STEP 2: Review available API endpoints
    context: The list of 29 API endpoints provided
    reason: I need to review all the endpoints to find the most relevant one

Looking at the list of endpoints, I need to identify those that involve retrieving attribute values from entities:

Several endpoints involve entities and attributes:
- #6: GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs (Retrieve Entity Attributes)
- #10: GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} (Get attribute data)
- #13: GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value (Get Attribute Value)

These are the most relevant ones to "retrieving entity attribute values".

EVALUATION:
    bloom: Analyzing API endpoints
    dim: Factual Knowledge
    quantity: 29 (all endpoints)
    human_effort: 4

STEP COMPLETE

STEP 3: Assess the most relevant endpoint
    context: The three endpoints identified in Step 2
    reason: I need to determine which one most precisely matches the user's intent

Let's analyze each of the three endpoints in detail:

1. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs (Retrieve Entity Attributes)
   This endpoint retrieves all attributes for a specific entity, including their data and metadata.

2. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName} (Get attribute data)
   This endpoint retrieves data for a specific attribute of a specific entity, including metadata.

3. GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value (Get Attribute Value)
   This endpoint specifically retrieves just the value of a specific attribute for a specific entity.

Since the user query is specifically about "attribute values", endpoint #13 is the most precise match, as it specifically focuses on retrieving the value of an attribute rather than the entire attribute data or all attributes.

EVALUATION:
    bloom: Evaluating endpoint relevance
    dim: Conceptual Knowledge
    quantity: 3 (three endpoints)
    human_effort: 5

STEP COMPLETE

STEP 4: Make final selection
    context: The analysis from Step 3
    reason: I need to provide a single definitive answer

Based on the detailed analysis, endpoint #13 (GET /v2/entities/{entityId}/attrs/{attrName}/value - Get Attribute Value) is the most relevant to the user query "retrieve entity attribute values".

This endpoint specifically focuses on retrieving attribute values, which is exactly what the user is asking for.

Therefore, the answer is 13.

EVALUATION:
    bloom: Applying selection criteria

        </context>

        <instructions>
        Do the task step by step.
        Each step must:
        - Perform exactly one logical action
        - Have exactly one conceptual target
        - be not devidable into smaller steps 
        - Produce exactly one concrete output
        - Be completable in isolation
        - Not require planning future steps

        Output the thinking process as detailed as possible.
        It is really important to output every little step of your reasoning, even if it seems obvious.

        Process exactly ONE step at a time. 
        You cannot reference or work on any other step until the current one is complete. 
        After completing one step, explicitly state "STEP COMPLETE" before starting the next.
        
        You can only use information from:
        - The original input
        - Results from previously completed steps
        - The current step you're working on
        You cannot reference or anticipate future steps.
        
        For each step:
        1. State what you're about to do
            - context: the explicit context information that is needed to complete the step
            - reason: the reasoning process that led to the step
        2. Do it immediately 
        3. Show the result
            - result: The actual concrete output produced (code, data, text) - not a description of what you will produce
        4. Evaluate the step
            - bloom: {objective} the Bloom's Taxonomy level and it's objective (max 7 words)
            - dim: the Knowledge Dimension
            - quantity: the number of context information items processed in this step. Items are either: entities, properties, relationships, paths, or lines of code.
            - human_effort: own evaluation of the human effort required to complete this step (from 1 to 10, where 1 is very easy and 10 is very hard)
        5. Move to next step

        If you find yourself working on multiple entities simultaneously, STOP immediately and restart with only the first incomplete entity.
        FINAL OUTPUT RULE: Only after ALL entities show 'ENTITY COMPLETE', combine all step results into the final deliverable.

        Example format:
        ...
        STEP 1: {step name}

STEP 1: Understand what makes a property numerical or non-numerical
context: The definitions provided in the task description
reason: I need to clearly understand the classification criteria before analyzing the properties

Numerical properties are defined as those that:
- Connect an entity with a measurable quantity or quantity concept (temperature, count, speed, etc.)
- This connection can be direct or indirect (through another class and property)

Non-numerical properties are defined as those that:
- Connect an entity with another entity or description (not a measurable quantity)

RESULT:
result: 
- Numerical properties: Connect to measurable quantities (directly or indirectly)
- Non-numerical properties: Connect to other entities or descriptions (not quantities)

STEP 8: Analyze brick:deprecatedInVersion
context: The property brick:deprecatedInVersion
reason: I need to determine if this property connects to a numerical value or not

EXECUTING:
The brick:deprecatedInVersion property seems to indicate the version in which an entity was deprecated. While versions often contain numbers (e.g., "2.0"), they are identifiers rather than measurable quantities. The property connects an entity to a version identifier, not to a quantity that can be measured.

RESULT:
result: brick:deprecatedInVersion is a non-numerical property as it connects to a version identifier, not a measurable quantity.

        </context>

        <instructions>
        Do the task step by step.
        Each step must:
        - Perform exactly one logical action
        - Have exactly one conceptual target
        - be not devidable into smaller steps 
        - Produce exactly one concrete output
        - Be completable in isolation
        - Not require planning future steps

        Output the thinking process as detailed as possible.
        It is really important to output every little step of your reasoning, even if it seems obvious.

        Process exactly ONE step at a time. 
        You cannot reference or work on any other step until the current one is complete. 
        After completing one step, explicitly state "STEP COMPLETE" before starting the next.
        
        You can only use information from:
        - The original input
        - Results from previously completed steps
        - The current step you're working on
        You cannot reference or anticipate future steps.
        
        For each step:
        1. State what you're about to do
            - context: the explicit context information that is needed to complete the step
            - reason: the reasoning process that led to the step
        2. Do it immediately 
        3. Show the result
            - result: The actual concrete output produced (code, data, text) - not a description of what you will produce
        4. Evaluate the step

            - human_effort: own evaluation of the human effort required to complete this step (from 1 to 10, where 1 is very easy and 10 is very hard)
        5. Move to next step

        If you find yourself working on multiple entities simultaneously, STOP immediately and restart with only the first incomplete entity.
        FINAL OUTPUT RULE: Only after ALL entities show 'ENTITY COMPLETE', combine all step results into the final deliverable.

        "thinking": "Alright, I need to classify a list of properties from an ontology into numerical and non-numerical categories. Let me break this down into steps to ensure I approach this systematically.

STEP 1: Understand the classification criteria
    context: The task is to classify ontology properties into numerical and non-numerical categories.
    reason: Before I can classify the properties, I need to clearly understand what makes a property "numerical" or "non-numerical" according to the task description.

EXECUTING: Extracting the criteria from the task description
From the task description, I understand that:
- Numerical properties are those that directly or indirectly (through another class and property) connect an entity with a measurable quantity or quantity concept, such as temperature, count, or speed.
- Non-numerical properties are those that connect an entity with another entity or description.

RESULT:
    result: 
    Numerical properties: Connect entities to measurable quantities (directly or indirectly)
    Non-numerical properties: Connect entities to other entities or descriptions

STEP 2: Analyze each property in the list
    context: List of properties to classify: ['rdfs:comment', 'brick:deprecationMitigationMessage', 'owl:deprecated', 'brick:hasSubstance', 'owl:equivalentClass', 'brick:deprecatedInVersion', 'rdfs:subClassOf', 'brick:hasQuantity', 'brick:hasAssociatedTag', 'brick:isReplacedBy', 'rdfs:seeAlso', 'skos:definition', 'owl:disjointWith', 'rdfs:label']
    reason: I need to examine each property one by one to determine if it connects to a numerical value or not.

EXECUTING: I'll analyze each property based on its name and the typical usage in ontologies.

1. rdfs:comment - This is a standard RDF Schema property used to provide human-readable descriptions of resources. It typically connects an entity to a string literal description.

2. brick:deprecationMitigationMessage - Based on the name, this seems to provide a message about how to mitigate the deprecation of a resource. It would connect to a text description.

3. owl:deprecated - This is a boolean property indicating whether a resource is deprecated. While it could be represented as 0/1, it's conceptually a status indicator rather than a measurable quantity.

4. brick:hasSubstance - This appears to connect an entity to the substance it contains or is made of, which would be another entity or concept, not a numerical value.

5. owl:equivalentClass - This is a standard OWL property that establishes an equivalence relationship between two classes. It connects classes to classes, not to numerical values.

6. brick:deprecatedInVersion - This likely refers to the version number in which a resource was deprecated. While versions often have numerical components, the version itself is conceptually an identifier rather than a measurable quantity.

7. rdfs:subClassOf - This is a standard RDF Schema property establishing a subclass relationship. It connects a class to its superclass, not to a numerical value.

8. brick:hasQuantity - This explicitly refers to a quantity, which strongly suggests it connects an entity to a measurable value or quantity concept.

9. brick:hasAssociatedTag - This appears to connect an entity with a tag or label, which would be another entity or a string, not a numerical value.

10. brick:isReplacedBy - This likely indicates that one resource is replaced by another resource, establishing a relationship between entities rather than connecting to a numerical value.

11. rdfs:seeAlso - This is a standard RDF Schema property that provides a reference to another resource for additional information. It connects resources to resources, not to numerical values.

12. skos:definition - This is a SKOS property for providing a complete explanation of the intended meaning of a concept. It typically connects to a text description.

13. owl:disjointWith - This is a standard OWL property that establishes that two classes have no members in common. It connects classes to classes, not to numerical values.

14. rdfs:label - This is a standard RDF Schema property for providing a human-readable name for a resource. It typically connects to a string literal.

RESULT:
    result: 
    Numerical properties:
    - brick:hasQuantity

    Non-numerical properties:
    - rdfs:comment

STEP 4: Review the classification for accuracy
    context: The classification done in Step 2 and formatted in Step 3
    reason: I should double-check my classification to ensure it correctly follows the criteria.

EXECUTING: Re-examining each property with a focus on whether it could indirectly connect to numerical values.

Looking at the criteria again:
- Numerical properties connect entities to measurable quantities (directly or indirectly)
- Non-numerical properties connect entities to other entities or descriptions

Let me reconsider each property:

1. rdfs:comment - Connects to a text description. Not numerical.
2. brick:deprecationMitigationMessage - Connects to a text message. Not numerical.
3. owl:deprecated - Boolean status indicator. Not a measurable quantity in the context of the ontology.
4. brick:hasSubstance - Connects to another entity (a substance). Not numerical.
5. owl:equivalentClass - Connects classes to classes. Not numerical.
6. brick:deprecatedInVersion - Connects to a version identifier. While versions may contain numbers, they are identifiers rather than measurable quantities.
7. rdfs:subClassOf - Connects classes in a hierarchy. Not numerical.
8. brick:hasQuantity - Explicitly connects to a quantity concept. Numerical.
9. brick:hasAssociatedTag - Connects to a tag or label. Not numerical.
10. brick:isReplacedBy - Connects resources to resources. Not numerical.
11. rdfs:seeAlso - References another resource. Not numerical.
12. skos:definition - Provides a text definition. Not numerical.
13. owl:disjointWith - Establishes a relationship between classes. Not numerical.
14. rdfs:label - Provides a text label. Not numerical.

I don't see any properties that I misclassified. The classification appears to be accurate.

RESULT:
    result: The classification is correct. Only "brick:hasQuantity" is a numerical property as it directly connects to quantity concepts. All other properties connect to entities, classes, or text descriptions, not to measurable quantities.

The 'numerical' array contains only "brick:hasQuantity".
The 'non_numerical' array contains all other properties.
This matches our verified classification from Step 4.
