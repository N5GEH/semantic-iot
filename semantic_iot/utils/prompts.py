        The overall goal is to generate a configuration for a building's ventilation system based on the available sensors and actuators.

        Requirements for the configuration file based on the SPARQL queries:
        1. List of all rooms in the building (identified by their URIs).
        2. For each room:
            - All ventilation devices (Air Systems) associated with the room.

            - All presence sensors available in the room, including their access methods/values.

        The configuration file must map each room to its available sensors and actuators, specifying how to access their data or control them.

        This is done by querying a extended knowledge graph with SPARQL to extract information about the building's systematic components, like:
        - Which rooms are available in the building?
        - Which ventilation devices are available in each room?
        - How to access the actuation points of each ventilation device?

        Do the task step by step with maximum consistency and precision.
        I need a complete step-by-step execution of the task, where each step is fully printed out, even if repetitive, for future analysis and evaluation.
        
        I want to use a standardized way to compare steps across different tasks.
        Therefore it is absolutely essential to follow the given definition of steps:

        
        # STEP DEFINITION

        ## CRITICAL STEP DEFINITION RULES
        Each step must satisfy ALL of these criteria:
        - Single Action: Performs exactly one distinct cognitive operation
        - Single Bloom Level: Can be classified with exactly one level of Bloom's Taxonomy
        - Single Output: Produces exactly one concrete, measurable result
        - Deterministic: Same input always produces same type of output
        - Atomic: Cannot be meaningfully subdivided while maintaining the same cognitive operation
        - Isolated: Can be completed without simultaneous work on other steps
        - Consistent Granularity: Steps handling similar data types should have similar granularity

        - Not an Iteration Counter: Skip actions that simply count iterations, repetitions, nodes of the flowchart process
        - Not a Decision: Does NOT just refers to do another step e. g.: 'Moving to next step'
        
        ## FLOWCHART NAVIGATION RULES
        - Each step must correspond to exactly one node in the flowchart.
        - Not every flowchart node must be a step.
        - Decision diamonds are not steps, but only used to decide which step to take next.
        - Decision diamonds can only be referenced in the "NEXT" section of a step.

        ## STEP VALIDATION CHECKLIST
        Before finalizing any step, verify:
        - Can you identify exactly one primary verb that describes the action?
        - Does the step require only one type of cognitive process?
        - If you removed any part of this step, would the remaining part still be meaningful?
        - Can you complete this step without starting the next one?
        - Does the step granularity match the estimated number of steps needed to complete the task?
        If any answer is "no", subdivide the step further.

        - Do you find yourself using "and" or "then" in a step description?
        - Are there missing steps creating a logical gap between steps?
        If any answer is "yes", subdivide the step further.
        
        
        # EXECUTION PROTOCOL

        ## PHASE 1: Task Analysis and Flowchart Creation
        1. Analyze the task complete requirements, instructions and constraints.
        2. Identify all process nodes and possible decision points and alternative paths.
            - If a node has multiple possible next steps, use a decision diamond to represent the decision point.
            - If a node may not be executed every time, use a decision diamond to be able to decide if the node is executed or not (e. g. because of conditional rules).
        3. Create a flowchart to visualize the conditional task structure.
        4. Estimate the number of steps needed to complete the task.
            - Consider the flowchart process nodes and decision points on how to process the input data
            - Consider the number of times to loop the flowchart over the input data
            
        ## PHASE 2: Step-by-Step Execution
        Execute the task following the flowchart process nodes and decision points, repeating the steps with the input data as needed.
        Process exactly ONE step at a time following this format: 

        STEP [N]: [step description]

        [if applicable, decide next step based on flowchart]
        - decision_point: [if applicable, specify the decision point]

        # TERM MAPPING INSTRUCTIONS: 
        <instructions>
        Based on the extraction of available Ontology Classes and Properties and the list of terms that need to be mapped to the ontology,
        for each term, you need to select the most appropriate ontology class or property for the domain entity or relation.
        Do not choose a class or property that is not in the list of available ontology classes or properties.
        The goal is to inherit the attributes and relations from the selected Ontology Class or Property.

        MAPPING CRITERIA: (in order of priority)
        1. Exact semantic match
        2. Hierarchical relationship (parent/child concepts)
        3. Functional equivalence (same purpose/behavior)
        4. Attribute similarity (same properties/characteristics)

        SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        - Distinguish locations, systems, devices, actuation points, sensors
        - Avoid category errors: don't confuse the thing itself with top-level infrastructure that supports the thing

        JUST FOR CLASSES:
        - Respect system hierarchies (building â†’ floor â†’ room â†’ equipment)
        - If the term seems to be a relation, select a class that would have this relation as a property.

        JUST FOR PROPERTIES:
        - Maintain the original direction of the relationship (subject â†’ predicate â†’ object), e. g.: is_instance_of NOT EQUAL TO is_instanciated_by

        You need to examine the available API endpoints and identify the most specific endpoint which returns only the raw numerical values of entity attributes.
        Merge the API endpoint with the host path to create a complete API endpoint URL.
        
        Each top-level object in the JSON file represents an entity, having a unique identifier.
        The key of the unique identifier that is equal across all entities, should be outputted as identifier_key.

        Each top-level object can be described by a specific class, which is then represented by an ontology class.

        # SEMANTIC-DRIVEN CLASS KEY SELECTION:
        Analyze all keys that appear in all top-level objects and evaluate their semantic contribution:

        Select class_keys by choosing keys that:
        - Provide meaningful semantic distinction between entities
        - Help differentiate entities that would otherwise appear similar
        - Contribute to more precise ontology class mapping
        - Create classes that represent distinct functional or behavioral categories
        
        Avoid keys that only provide:
        - Pure metadata (timestamps, IDs, technical configuration)
        - Values that change frequently (current states, measurements)
        - Implementation details that don't affect semantic meaning

        The combination of selected class_keys should create semantically meaningful and distinct entity classes.


        The class of the top-level object is a string that contains the values of the class_keys joined by underscores in senseful order.
        For each top-level object in the JSON (unique value of class_keys) retrieve suitable ontology classes.
        Use the Term Mapping Instructions to select the most appropriate ontology classes.

        Each entity can have multiple properties, which are represented as key-value pairs inside a top-level object in the JSON file.

        Within the JSON structure, you'll encounter properties that define relationships between top-level objects (such as location associations, containment relationships, or other connections). 
        These relational properties should be mapped to appropriate ontology properties.
        The ontology structure should represent the relatonships between top-level objects through relational properties.

        Within the JSON structure, you'll encounter entities, that can have a numerical value (accesible by the API endpoint).
        You need to make sure, that those entities that need to have a numerical value in the JSON, also can have a numerical value in the ontology.
        Therefore you need to check if the selected ontology class for the entity having a numerical value supports having a numerical property, either directly or through inheritance.
        
        If gaps exist and additional structural elements are needed, create supplementary entities to fill these gaps, creating a valid connection of the original entity and a numeric property.
        
        If there are the newly created entities (extra nodes), they need to be mapped to ontology classes as well.
        It should be ensured that these new ontology classes now have the numerical property capabilities, either directly or through inheritance.
        The entire structure requires assessment to ensure all numerical property requirements are properly addressed. This verification and enhancement process should continue until the mapping is complete and all numerical values have appropriate ontological representation.

        In the JSON file, the added extra nodes are connected to the parent entities through a relation.
        Find an ontology property for the relation of the extra node to the parent entity. 
        Pay attention to the direction of the property to be from the extra node TO the parent entity (extra node â†’ parent entity)!
        Use the term_mapper tool with an appropriate query.
        If there are no extra nodes, leave empty.

        # There are one or more keys that appear in all top-level objects which are used to identify or describe the class even if the object seems to be a property.

        - Devices must be properly connected to their locations

        For an entity or extra node having a numerical property, 
        the property 'rdf:value <{{API_ENDPOINT_URL}}>' must be added. in the {{API_ENDPOINT_URL}} template, adapt its variables to match the attribute of this entity and use the identifier for the API call.
        
        Extra Nodes establish a connection between an entity and a numerical value when the entity's ontology class does not include a numerical property.

        Each TriplesMap must define its data source via rml:logicalSource with 
        the rml:referenceFormulation ql:JSONPath, rml:source "placeholder.json" and an iterator to filter entities by type.
        ### Iterator Constraints <constraints> 
        Put iterator in single quotes.
        Avoid using spaces in the iterator string!
        Ensure all JSONPath expressions use simple, widely supported operators.
        - Allowed: '$', '*', '.'
        - Not allowed: '?', '@', filter expressions
        </constraints>

        Each TriplesMap must define a rr:subjectMap with
        rr:template "http://example.com/{{ENTITY_TYPE}}/{id}" for dynamic URI generation from data and rr:class {{ONTOLOGY_CLASS}} for type classification
        
        For entities that provide or expose numerical data via API endpoint,
        a rr:predicateObjectMap must be added with rdf:value and an objectMap for API endpoint URL with rr:template "{{API_ENDPOINT_URL}}"

        For entities that reference other entities in the data source, 
        a rr:predicateObjectMap must be added with:
        - {{ONTOLOGY_PROPERTY}} as predicate
        - an objectMap referencing rr:parentTriplesMap ex:Mapping{{ENTITY_TYPE}}
        - Join conditions must match the data source field names and structure
        - System hierarchies, the datamodel relationships and devices and their locations must be properly represented through join conditions and their child and parent

        In the JSON file, the added extra nodes are connected to the parent entities through a 'relatedTo' relation, with the parent entity's 'id' as value.
        The according ontology property is the extra_node_relation_to_parent from the context.

        Uppercase terms in brackets {{}} are placeholders for values given in the context. Strictly choose the values from the preprocessing of the JSON file, except for the variables inside API_ENDPOINT_URL, which can be adapted to match the use case.
        For the '{{id}}', use the value of the identifier_key from the context.

For the RDF graph to properly support configuration generation, the following elements are essential:

Rule 1: Entity Declaration
Always: Every IoT entity and each Extra Node must be declared with:
- A unique URI following the pattern <http://example.com/{{ENTITY_TYPE}}/{{ID}}>
- A type classification using a {{ONTOLOGY_CLASS}}

Rule 2: Ontology Prefixes
Always: The knowledge graph must begin with:
- {{ONTOLOGY_PREFIXES}} declaration
- Standard RDF prefix: @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
- Do not add prefixes for the API endpoint, but use the full URI in angle brackets.

Rule 3: Numerical Data Source
If: An entity provides or exposes numerical data (accessible by API endpoint) 
Then: Add the property rdf:value <{{API_ENDPOINT_URL}}>

Rule 4: Relational Connections
If: An entity has relationships or connections to other entities 
Then: Add one or more properties using {{ONTOLOGY_PROPERTY}} <http://example.com/{{ENTITY_TYPE}}/{{ID}}>
- System hierarchies must be properly represented
- The datamodel must be represented correctly

# RML Mapping Rules
For the RML mapping to properly transform IoT data sources to RDF triples, the following RML-specific elements are essential:

Rule 1: TriplesMap Structure
Always: Every IoT entity type must have a corresponding TriplesMap declared with:
- A unique mapping URI following the pattern ex:Mapping{{ENTITY_TYPE}}
- A type classification: a rr:TriplesMap

Rule 2: RML-Specific Prefixes
Always: The RML mapping must include RML-specific prefixes:
- {{ONTOLOGY_PREFIXES}} declaration
- Standard prefixes: @prefix ex: <http://example.com#> . and @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
# - Do not add prefixes for the API endpoint, but use the full URI in template strings.

Rule 3: Data Source Configuration
Always: Each TriplesMap must define its data source via rml:logicalSource:
- rml:source "placeholder.json"
- rml:referenceFormulation ql:JSONPath (for JSON data)
- rml:iterator '$[?(@.type=="{{ENTITY_TYPE}}")]' to filter and iterate over entities by type

Rule 4: Subject Template Generation
Always: Each TriplesMap must define a rr:subjectMap with:
- rr:template "http://example.com/{{ENTITY_TYPE}}/{id}" for dynamic URI generation from data
- rr:class {{ONTOLOGY_CLASS}} for type classification

Rule 5: API Endpoint Value Mapping
If: An entity provides or exposes numerical data via API endpoint
Then: Add a rr:predicateObjectMap with:
- rr:predicate rdf:value
- rr:objectMap with rr:template "{{API_ENDPOINT_URL}}" (template-based URI generation)

Rule 6: Cross-Entity Reference Mapping
If: An entity references other entities in the data source
Then: Add a rr:predicateObjectMap with:
- rr:predicate {{ONTOLOGY_PROPERTY}}
- rr:objectMap referencing rr:parentTriplesMap ex:Mapping{{ENTITY_TYPE}}
- rr:joinCondition specifying rr:child "{{CHILD_JOIN_FIELD}}" and rr:parent "{{PARENT_JOIN_FIELD}}"
- Join conditions must match the data source field names and structure

1. Based on the extraction of available API endpoints, select the single most relevant endpoint for accessing numerical values of entities.

1. Map JSON Entities to ontology Classes considering the Term Mapping Instructions.

2. Decide which relations in the JSON file are 'numeric properties' and 'relational properties'.
    numeric properties are properties that have a numerical value, like temperature, humidity, etc.
    relational properties are properties that have a relation to another entity, like 'isLocatedIn', 'belongsTo', etc.

2.1 Map the relational properties to ontology properties.
    Do not map the numerical properties to ontology properties.

2.2 Check if the selected ontology classes for the entities of the numerical properties have an (inherited) numerical property.

2.3 If there are extra nodes to be added, add a new JSON entity to an imagenary list of extra nodes.
    The extra nodes should have the name of the property they come from
    Map this newly created entity to an ontology class by using the query '{{property_name}}'.

3. Now check again, if the newly created entities have an (inherited) numerical property and do steps 2.2 and 2.3 again before continuing.
